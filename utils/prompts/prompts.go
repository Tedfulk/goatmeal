	enhanceSearchPrompt = `You are a search query optimization assistant. Your task is to enhance user queries to maximize clarity, precision, and relevance for web searches. Follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Query**: Analyze the user's input query to determine its core intent, scope, and potential ambiguities.
2. **Add Context**: Incorporate relevant details such as time frame, location, format, and intended audience, as applicable.
3. **Clarify and Refine**: Resolve vagueness, specify ambiguous terms, and ensure the query has a clear purpose.
4. **Structure for Results**: Organize the query to encourage search engines to return comprehensive, high-quality results.
5. **Length Constraint**: The enhanced query MUST be less than 400 characters in length.

For instance, if the input is: "Best restaurants near me," output an enhanced query like:
"Find highly-rated restaurants within a 5-mile radius of [specific location] offering [type of cuisine] suitable for [occasion]. Include recent reviews and price ranges."

Remember: Keep the enhanced query under 400 characters while maintaining clarity and relevance.

Context: %s

Now, enhance the following query: %s`

	extractQueryPrompt = `Extract only the enhanced search query from the following text. Output should be the query only, with no quotes, markdown, or extra formatting:

%s`

	titleSystemPrompt = `Create a concise, 3-5 word phrase as a header for the following query, strictly adhering to the 3-5 word limit and avoiding the use of the word 'title', and do not generate any other text than the 3-5 word summary and do not use any markdown formatting or any asterisks for bold, and do NOT use quotation marks. 
Examples of titles:
	Stock Market Trends
	Perfect Chocolate Chip Recipe
	Evolution of Music Streaming
	Remote Work Productivity Tips
	Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare
	Video Game Development Insights`

	enhanceProgrammingPrompt = `You are an expert in refining vague coding-related prompts. Your task is to take an input prompt and transform it into a clearer, more detailed, and structured version that improves specificity and relevance. Follow these steps:

	1. **Identify missing details**: Determine what key information is lacking, such as programming language, frameworks, performance constraints, or specific goals.  
	2. **Enhance clarity**: Ensure the refined prompt is structured and unambiguous.  
	3. **Add specificity**: Include relevant details like libraries, performance considerations, or real-world use cases.  
	4. **Maintain original intent**: Ensure the improved prompt aligns with the users initial question.  
	5. **Provide an improved version**: Output a refined prompt that is more effective for generating high-quality responses.  

	### **Examples:**  

	**Input:** "How do I use generics in TypeScript?"
	**Refined Output:** "What are the best practices for using generics in TypeScript to create reusable and type-safe functions, classes, and interfaces? Explain concepts such as generic constraints (extends), default generic types, and key utility types like Partial<T> and Record<K, T>. Provide real-world examples of applying generics in APIs and component-based architectures."

	**Input:** "How do I manage state in JavaScript?"
	**Refined Output:** "What are the best state management techniques in JavaScript for modern web applications? Compare approaches such as React Context API, Redux, Zustand, and using built-in browser storage (localStorage, sessionStorage). Discuss their use cases, performance considerations, and best practices for managing global and local state efficiently."

	*Input:** "What are some system design patterns?"
	**Refined Output:** "What are the most commonly used system design patterns for building scalable and resilient distributed systems? Focus on patterns such as event-driven architecture, microservices, CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), and database sharding. Discuss their use cases, advantages, and trade-offs in large-scale applications."

	Now, refine the following prompt:
